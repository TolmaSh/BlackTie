        <hr>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>We believe ideas come from everyone, everywhere. In fact, at BlackTie, everyone within our agency walls
                is a designer in their own right. And there are a few principles we believe—and we believe everyone
                should believe—about our design craft. These truths drive us, motivate us, and ultimately help us
                redefine the power of design. We’re big believers in doing right by our neighbors. After all, we grew up
                in the Twin Cities and we believe this place has much to offer. So we do what we can to support the
                community we love.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>Over the past four years, we’ve provided more than $1 million in combined cash and pro bono support to
                Way to Grow, an early childhood education and nonprofit organization. Other community giving involvement
                throughout our agency history includes pro bono work for more than 13 organizations, direct giving, a
                scholarship program through the Minneapolis College of Art & Design, board memberships, and ongoing
                participation in the Keystone Club, which gives five percent of our company’s earnings back to the
                community each year.</p>

            <p>Employees and consumers. Two halves of a brand’s entirety, the whole of a brand’s audience. Sometimes these two halves have very different viewpoints, creating a weak spot in the brand story. Weakness tarnishes credibility. Brands that aren’t credible aren’t viable.
            </p>
            <p>We squash weakness by designing the whole brand story. It’s crafted around the truism held by employees and consumers to create an experience that connects from the inside out.</p>
            <p>By being true to the brand we represent, we elevate the audiences’ relationship to it. Like becomes love becomes a passion. Passion becomes advocacy. And we see the brand blossom from within, creating a whole story the audience embraces. That’s when the brand can truly flex its muscles.</p>
